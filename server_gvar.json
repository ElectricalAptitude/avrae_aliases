The stains spread to everything you touch, although if something you touch does not belong to you it washes off. As a bonus action, you can grant yourself a +4 bonus to all saving throws or attack rolls or ability checks (choose one) for one minute. At the end of that minute, you lose the bonus and instead have a -2 on all saving throws, attack rolls and ability checks until you have washed all the stains off. This requires spending at least half an hour scrubbing yourself with soap.\n\n**Amber**: Leaves slightly sticky stains, as if coated in a thin layer of honey.\n**Amethyst**: Leaves faint purple stains that glow slightly in the dark\n**Garnet**: Leaves rusty stains that look like old blood\n**Jade**: Leaves mossy green stains\n**Black Tourmaline**: Leaves dark, ink-like stains",
