# CWM Discord Server Avrae Collection

This is an organized index of the server commands for the CWM Discord Server.
You can use the above folders to find commands.

Most of the class aliases utilize the !level alias to set up counters and check for validity so be sure to set that first before using them.

Check out the !cwm command to view server information and aliases.
