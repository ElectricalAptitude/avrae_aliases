# Server Commands

These involve tools used for rules within the CWM Server

## The sgold Command
**sgold** - `!sgold fighter` `!sgold Wizard 2` `!sgold Barbarian 1`
	This command is used for rolling your starter gold for the server. Starting gold depends on what tier you are rolling your character at but for new players it is always tier 1. If you don't supply a tier then it will assume you are rolling at tier 1. The class name is not case sensitive but does need to be spelled correctly.
	The command will also roll the gold you would start with if you choose to not take the starting equipment listed in the PHB.
	`!sgold class [tier]`
	

## Other Server Commands

**convert** - `!convert 0 c` `!convert 12 mph` `!convert 70 f`
	This command takes in a number and a unit and converts it from metric to imperial and vice-versa.
	It is used with the !weather command to convert units.
	Will currently only convert between Celcius and Fahrenheit, or mph and jph.
	`!convert number (c | f | mph | kph)`
